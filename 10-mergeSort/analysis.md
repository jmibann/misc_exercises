This sorting method implementation make use of 2 functions:

1- merge: which iterates once and at the samet ime over 2 arrays to be merged, O(n)= n;
2- mergeSort: wich make splits the arrays into 2 subarrays, and so on until array size is 1 element long. O(n)= log2(n)


Merge Sort Algorithm: O(n) = n*log2(n)
